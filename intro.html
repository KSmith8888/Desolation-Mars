        <h3>Entry</h3>
        <p>It has now been 19 months since communication was lost with the colonies. There has been no way to tell what happened. Every possible outreach that can me made from Earth has been attempted. The journey still takes so long, it's impossible to know what we're walking into. </p><p>Now that we have reached the planet we should finally be able to get some answers. Hopefully their short-range communications are still functional.</p>
